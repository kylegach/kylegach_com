A personal website & portfolio built with [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/), a fantastic little static site generator powered by [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).

It is styled using [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) and the [cssnext](https://github.com/MoOx/postcss-cssnext) plugin, which allows me to use all sorts of cool future CSS right now. I based my styling system heavily on [Basscss](https://github.com/basscss/basscss), which is one of the most inspiring and mind-expanding things I’ve ever come across in this industry. I made two significant deviations from Basscss: 1) adopting Harry Roberts’ [clever syntax](http://csswizardry.com/2015/08/bemit-taking-the-bem-naming-convention-a-step-further/#responsive-suffixes) for responsive suffixes, and 2) trying to adhere to a `propertyName-value` structure in the class names for consistency.
